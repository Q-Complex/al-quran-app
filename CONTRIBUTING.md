## Contribution Workflow

### Forking the Repository

Before making any changes, fork the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to create pull requests directly from your fork.

### Creating a Feature Branch

Branch out from the `main` branch for your feature development. It's a good practice to create a branch with a descriptive name.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
```

### Making Changes

1. **Understand the Codebase**: Familiarize yourself with the Directory Structure and existing codebase to ensure your changes align with the project's architecture.

2. **Develop Your Feature**: Implement your feature or fix the identified issue. Ensure that your changes are well-documented and adhere to the [Code Guidelines](#code-guidelines).

### Committing Your Changes

1. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in each commit message.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature: YourFeatureName"
   ```

2. **Commit Often**: Break down your changes into multiple commits if necessary to improve readability and reviewability.

### Pushing to the Branch

Push your changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin feature/YourFeatureName
```

### Opening a Pull Request

1. **Submit a Pull Request**: Navigate to the original repository and click on the **Pull Requests** tab. Click the **New Pull Request** button, and select your branch from the dropdown menu.

2. **Fill Out the Pull Request Template**: Provide a detailed description of your changes, including any relevant sections such as **Screenshot(s)**, **Fixes**, **Checklist**, and **Additional Information**.

3. **Request Review**: Once submitted, your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions.
